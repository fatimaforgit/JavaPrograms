Tokens: Smallest unit of a program is known as token.

3 tokens in any java program are:

1. Keywords
2. Identifiers
3. Literals

Keywords:

Predefined words that has some kind of predefined meaning in programming language.

Ex: class, public, int, float, double, package etc

There are 50 keywords in java.

Rule: keywords should be written in lower case. If written in upper case compile error pops up.


Identifiers:

Programmer/user defined words are called identifiers

or

The words for which programmer gives meaning are called identifiers.

ex: name of a class, name of a variable, name of a function name of package, name of interface

Rules:
1. can be alphanumeric but can not start with numbers
2. It can contain only 2 special characters underscore and dollar sign ( _ and $ )
3. It can start with underscore or dollar sign ( _ and $ )
4. It can include space
5. keywords cannot be identifiers

Literals:

These are values used in the program. there are 4 types:

1. Numeric literals
2. Character literals
3. String literals
4. Boolean literals

Numeric literals: 
All numbers written with java program are called numeric literals.These are charaterised into 
(1)Integer literals 
(2) Floatng point literals. 

Ex: 10, 4.5, -10, 0, 1 etc.


Character literals: 
any character of the keyboard enclosed within single quote with one character at a time are called character literals. 

Ex: 'A', 'b', '?', ' ', '!', '8' where as '20' is invalid


String literal: 
Anything enclosed within double quotes are called string literals.

Ex:"Hello","#@$%123","A"," ",""(empty string and is allowed)


Boolean Literals:
there are only two boolean literals: True and false. Boolean literals are used to take dicisions. 
true and false are the only 2 boolean literals hence also called as keywords or reserved words.
Note:0 and 1 are not boolean literals they are numeric literals in java.
true and false to be used in small case only.
