//Numeric literals: All numbers written with java program are called numeric literals.These are charaterised into (1)Integer literals (2) Floatng point literals. Ex: 10, 4.5, -10, 0, 1 etc.
//Character literals: any character of the keyboard enclosed within single quote with one character at a time are called character literals. Ex: 'A', 'b', '?', ' ', '!', '8' where as '20' is invalid
//string literal: Anything enclosed within double quotes are called string literals.Ex:"Hello","#@$%123","A"," ",""(empty string and is allowed)
//Boolean Literals:there are only two boolean literals: True and false. Boolean literals are used to take dicisions. True and false are the only 2 boolean literals hence also called as keywords or reserved words.Note:0 and 1 are not boolean literals they are numeric literals in java.
